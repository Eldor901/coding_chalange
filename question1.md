js is dynamically type language by its self. during interpretation, it itself solves 
the problems with types and that's why apperars a lot of bugs on the programs. typacal example 
```sh
 2 + '2' = 22
 2 - '2' = 0
```

comparing with popular languages python js much more bad organized language . for the aforementioned operatios python will say "hey buddy you can not add different types"
there a lot of fundamental mistakes and i told only one of them
